    <h3 class="text-center">Covid-19 Statement and Protocols</h3>
    <p>
      As COVID-19 remains a threat and we get closer to the Greenbriar School
      fall season, prospective parents and students would normally be planning
      to come to the school property. We want to be sure everyone knows the
      additional protocols in place regarding Greenbriar School access.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assure the safety of those who live and work on the property,
      Greenbriar School is closed for any drop-by visits until further notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only visitors who have made arrangements in advance, and those
      arrangements are approved by the School Administration, may come on to the
      property. Minimally, to receive approval to come onto the school property,
      visitors will need to state they are free of any COVID-19 symptoms, be
      willing to prove they are not running a fever, agree to wear a protective
      mask and/or protective gloves upon request; and wash their hands before
      and after touching any hard surfaces on the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Greenbriar School parents, students, volunteers, employees, and
      community residents are required to respect those practicing social
      distancing; and recommended health protocols. Visitors are expected to
      follow these protocols as well. There will be no repercussions for those
      who choose not to participate when standard health protocols are not
      available or being enforced.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been hard at work exploring ways that we can open our doors and
      return to our campus as safely as possible in the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a bit about what returning in the Fall will look like for
      Greenbriar School:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Smaller classes (10 students to 1 teacher)</li>
      <li>Sensible, up-to-date safety protocols</li>
      <li>
        A balance of academics, arts and social-emotional learning to spark joy
        and inspiration in learning
      </li>
      <li>A lot more outdoor education/play in the gardens and shady spaces</li>
      <li>Even more hands on, project based learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is more to come in our evolving framework. We are passionate about
      holistic education and see these challenging times as an opportunity to
      dive into an adaptive model of education and be of service to our
      community.

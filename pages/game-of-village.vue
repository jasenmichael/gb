      <h1>Game of Village</h1>
      <h2 class="mt-4">What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        It's an experiential and hands-on class for ages 8-17. An adaptable
        curriculum centered around child-led adventures as homesteaders.
        Providing an environment where they learn through play, creating a
        miniature village.
      </p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        15 "episodes" overseen by Commissioners (teachers). Undertaking one
        objective at a time, kids work together to build as a community.
      </p>

      <h2>What is learned?</h2>
      <p>
        Based in Howard Gardner's multi-intelligence theory. Kids create a tiny
        village themselves while learning to use tools, math, spatial,
        linguistic, and interpersonal skills. Learning about participatory
        democracy, entrepreneurship, and more.
      </p>
      <h2>What do we hope to accomplish?</h2>
      <p>
        We hope to accomplish fostering excitement! Teaching new skills! Honing
        creativity and imagination, which is all too often thwarted in many
        kids' educational journey. Learning through play using all the senses.
      </p>

      <h2>Where is it?</h2>
      <p>
        Located on a 170-acre wooded intentional community between Bastrop and
        Elgin. We believe learning how to be a community is paramount to
        fostering teamwork, empathy, and strong social skills. We are almost
        exclusively an outdoor facility. That means: -bring water with you -you
        might get dirty -environmental awareness (wild animals, hazards, etc.)

      <p class="text-center">
        Greenbriar school was a part of the "free school" movement that began in
        the 1960's

        Fueled in part by the belief that we are all life long learners, that we
        learn best in a safe, supportive atmosphere, and that learning takes
        place everywhere, not just in a classroom.

          The 1970s and early 1980s -
        </span>
        For better part of a decade, Greenbriar School bused many children to
        and from Austin Texas, to the 170 acre wooded property. As the growth of
        Austin happened, other "Alternative Education" options became available.
        The school evolved as the property began to deveolp, many contributors
        in those days moved to the property and began to building roads, and
        structures. For years there was no electricity, eventually the power
        grid was tied in, while one side of the property remains "off the grid".
        to this day. Later a water well and pump was installed. Most of the
        original buildings were built with entirely recycled, salvaged, or
        donated materials.

          The 1980s throught the early 2000s -
        </span>
        The Community grew to have more than 50 residents, most activities were
        community focused, and since there was one primary kitchen, everyone ate
        together as a group. The School became a Community of parents, children,
        and volunteers using a model of consensus decision making.

          2001 Fire at the Main -
        </span>
        In 2001 the "Main" building structure burned to ground. We lost many
        important documents, aside from losing our primary community facility.

        <span style="font-weight: 401;">
          Present -
        </span>
        After the fire many folks left or moved on, not a lot of activity
        happened for some years. Many of the original buildings were in need of
        repair, or had been completly consumed by the forest. A new focus was
        born and has propelled massive clean-up efforts, re-building buildings
        and roads. We are working hard to continue to improve ourselves and our
        Educational programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have developed a dynamic and flexible student centered curriculum. We
        provide a space and facility that is constantly changing to meet the
        needs of our students based on their current interests.
